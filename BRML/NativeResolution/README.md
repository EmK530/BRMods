# NativeResolution
A simple mod to let you control core rendering features to increase the game's quality.

### Current features
- Render scale control
- Widescreen

### Important information
<b>Where is the config file?</b><br>
When you first start the game with the mod it should create a folder next to your mods folder called "config"<br>
In there is a text file that you can modify.

### Drawbacks
Widescreen currently has a problem where 2D elements are stuck at the base resolution.<br>
This will hopefully be solved in the future.
