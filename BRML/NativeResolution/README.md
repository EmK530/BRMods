# NativeResolution
A simple mod to let you control core rendering features to increase the game's quality.

## Current features
- Render scale control
- Widescreen

## Important information
<b>Where is the config file?</b><br>
When you first start the game with the mod it should create a folder next to your mods folder called "config"<br>
In there is a text file that you can modify.

## Drawbacks
<b>Widescreen:</b><br>
- Widescreen currently has a problem where 2D elements are stuck at the base resolution.<br>
This will hopefully be solved in the future.<br>
- The UI elements have not been modified in any way, the canvas has simply been centered to look better.
- If your aspect ratio is less than 16:9 the UI sides will be cut off, no intention to work around.
